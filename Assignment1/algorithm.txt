1. Goal
	The goal of this program is to use the power of recursion to reverse a word in C.
	This is to be done without any global variables or the built in reverse string.
2. Input
	The only two inputs this prgram has is the word that is to be reversed, and Y or
	N to determine to loop the program again or end it.
3. Output
	The only output this program has is the reversed version of the word that the user
	inputs.
4. Step by Step Details
	
	The first thing that this program does is ask the user to input a word that they wish
	to be reversed. The program stores that input into a variable. It then runs a function
	that will reverse the word using recursion. It will do this by looping through a for 
	loop for the length of the variable. It will store each letter in a temporary location
	and move that letter to the end. At the same time a static int will be used to move the
	letters from the end to the beginning. This will repeat until the whole word has been gone
	through. Once the static int is greater than the decreasing size int, the program will reset
	the static int to 0 so it can be done again. Then the completed word will be printed out for
	the user. Then the user will choose to either run the enitre program again (Y) or to end the program (N).
