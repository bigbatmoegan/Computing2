1. Goal
	The goal of this project is to make a race between the Tortise and the Hare. It is 
	to be done with using pointers.
2. Input
	There will be no user input into this program it will all run once it is ran.
3. Output
	The output of this program will be a race between a Torise and a Hare. This will all
	be done automatically and with random number generation. It will be random each time. 
4. Step-by-Step Details
	This program will print "Welcome to CSCI 240s Tortoise vs Hare race!" then the race will
	commence. The program will generate a roll based on the Hare's probability and give a
	result in movement based on the roll. The same thing will happen for the Tortoise. Once 
	both have rolled, the print function will print them based on where they are at the time 
	of that current roll. The Hare will be set to 0 if the result of a roll puts the Hare behind
	the starting line. This will all happen until either the Tortoise of the Hare has rolled 
	a 50 or over. But since the racer can not go over 50, the value will be set to 50. Then 
	the final position will be printed showing the winner right next to the finish line. Then a
	message will display showing who has won the race, then the program will return 0 to show
	successful completion.
