Bubble Sort Analysis:
	The Big-O Time complexity of Bubble Sort is Ω(n) for best case,
	Θ(n^2) for average case, and O(n^2) for the worst case scenario. 
	The relation between Big-O and the Time Function is that Big O is
	the worst case scenario of the time function. Big O represents the
	time it will take for a certain sort algorithm to run.
	



Insertion Sort Analysis:

	The relation between Big-O and the Time Function is that Big-O is
	the worst case scenario of the time function. Big O represents the
	time it will take for a certain sort algorithm to run.
