1. Goal
	The goal of this program is to load in a line of numbers from a text file
	and put them into a vector or an array. Then the program will run 1 of 2 
	sorting algorithms on the vector or array depending on what the user selects.
	It will them print out the new sorted vector and take the user back to the menu.
	This will repeat until the user chooses to exit the program.
2. Input
	The input for this assignment is a text file that has the 50 integers that
	will be loaded into the vector or array. There will also be user input that
	will be used to determine what the user wants to do based on the listed menus.
3. Output
	The output of this program will be two menus that will ask the user what they 
	want to do. The vector or array will be printed out unsorted once the user
	picks to load it. Then once sorted based on the users selection, it will be
	printed out in ascending order.
4. Step by Step Process
	A menu that says "1. Load Integers (From File)" and "2. Exit Program". If the 
	user selects 2, then the program ends. If the user selects 1, then the program
	will read in from the text file all the integers and push them into a vector
	or array. The vector or array will then print out as is, which is not sorted
	yet. Then a second menu will appear. This menu will say: 
	1. Insertion Sort
	2. Bubble Sort
	3. Exit Program
	If the user enters 3, then the program will end. If the user selects either 1 or
	2, then the respective sort function will be ran and the vector or array will be 
	printed out in ascending order. Then the program will return to the main menu, 
	where the user chooses to either load the integers again or close the program. Once
	the user selects either exit program choice, then all objects will be deleted and the program will end.
