1. Goal
	The goal of this project is to read a list of students from a text file,
	load the students from the file into objects, store them on the Stack 
	ADT, print the Stack of students, and then exit the program.
2. Input
	The input from the user will be: A "1" to load the students from the 
	text file they are in. A "2" to print all the students off of the Stack. 
	And a "3" to exit the program. 
3. Output
	The output of this will be a message saying the students have been loaded
	from the file, A full list of students from the Stack, and a message
	telling the user goodbye.
4. Step by Step Process
	This program will first begin by loading in all of the necessary librarys
	in order to successfully run the program. Then the menu will be displayed
	asking what the user would like to do. If the user selects "1", then the
	program will load the text file into the progam, and create a new object
	for each student. It will also then store each object onto the Stack ADT
	until each student has been loaded in. Once this is done then the program
	will tell the user that the students have been loaded. It will then return
	to the menu. If the user selects "2", it will then unload each object in a 
	loop and then will print the values of each object. Once the Stack is empty
	it will then return to the main menu. If the user selects "3", then the 
	program will tell the user goodbye and end the program.
