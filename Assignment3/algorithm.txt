1. Goal
	The goal of this project is to simulate the basketball game
	of horse using objects in both C++ and Java.
2. Input
	The only input of this project is the user choosing to either
	play again using a "Y", or to terminate the program using a 
	"N".
3. Output
	The output will be a welcome to the game message. Then the game
	will play and the result of each shot will be displayed. When a
	player misses their shot and the other makes it, the player who
	missed will be added a letter and indented. This will repeat until
	one player has the full word of horse. A question to replay or not 
	will be asked, then will either repeat the process or end the program
4. Step by Step Details
	The game will begin by displaying a greeting to the user. Then the 
	program will create two objects of players. Then the game will begin
	inside a while loop. These objects will then call their get shot
	functions to retrieve whether they hit their shot or miss it. Then
	the main will compare whether they both hit, both miss, or one makes
	and one misses. If both made or both miss, then the loop will
	continue as normal. If one makes and the other one misses, then the
	one who missed will add a letter to their unique array. Then the 
	number of misses for that player will increase by one, and the loop
	will repeat. Once a player misses 5 shots, the loop ends and the winner
	is displayed. Then a new loop starts to ask the user what they want to do. 
	If the user inputs "Y", the main loop will re run with all new players.
	If the user inputs "N", the players will be deleted and the main will end.
	If anything else is entered, then it will ask again until either Y or N is 
	entered.
